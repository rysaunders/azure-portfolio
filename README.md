# Security Portfolio: Azure Cloud Security Journey

> Documenting my transition from traditional penetration testing to Azure cloud security engineering

[![Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/security-portfolio/workflows/Azure%20Static%20Web%20Apps%20CI/CD/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/security-portfolio/actions)

## üéØ Project Overview

This repository contains my learning portfolio as I study for the AZ-500 (Azure Security Technologies) certification and transition from traditional cybersecurity roles to cloud security engineering. The portfolio itself is built using Azure security best practices and serves as a practical demonstration of skills learned.

**Live Site:** [https://YOUR-SITE.azurestaticapps.net](https://YOUR-SITE.azurestaticapps.net)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Frontend:** Azure Static Web Apps
- **Security:** Content Security Policy, security headers, HTTPS enforcement
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions with Azure integration
- **Monitoring:** Azure Application Insights (planned)
- **Future:** Azure Functions for dynamic content, Azure Key Vault integration

## üìö Learning Journey

### Current Focus: AZ-500 Certification Path
- **Week 1:** Azure Fundamentals & Identity Management ‚úÖ
- **Week 2:** Network Security & Platform Protection (In Progress)
- **Week 3-12:** Comprehensive security implementations and documentation

### Key Learning Areas
- Azure Identity and Access Management
- Azure network security and monitoring
- Azure security operations and incident response
- Cloud security best practices and frameworks

## üîß Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/security-portfolio.git
cd security-portfolio

# Open in your preferred editor
code .

# For local testing, you can use any static web server
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000 --directory src

# Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server src -p 8000
```

## üöÄ Deployment

This site deploys automatically to Azure Static Web Apps via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the main branch.

### Manual Deployment (if needed)
```bash
# Using Azure CLI
az staticwebapp create \
  --name security-portfolio-site \
  --resource-group rg-security-portfolio \
  --source https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/security-portfolio \
  --location eastus2 \
  --branch main \
  --app-location "/" \
  --api-location "api" \
  --output-location "src"
```

See [docs/deployment-guide.md](docs/deployment-guide.md) for detailed setup instructions.
