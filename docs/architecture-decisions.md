## ADR-001: Platform Choice - Azure Static Web Apps

**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision Maker:** Project Owner  

### Context
Need to choose hosting platform for learning portfolio that demonstrates Azure skills while being cost-effective for learning purposes.

### Options Considered
1. **GitHub Pages** - Free, simple, but doesn't demonstrate Azure experience
2. **Azure App Service** - Full featured but overkill and expensive for static site
3. **Azure Static Web Apps** - Perfect fit for static sites with Azure integration
4. **Azure Blob Storage + CDN** - Complex setup for minimal benefit

### Decision
**Chose Azure Static Web Apps** for the following reasons:
- Free tier available (perfect for learning)
- Built-in GitHub Actions integration (demonstrates DevOps skills)
- Automatic HTTPS and global CDN
- Built-in staging environments
- Easy to secure with custom headers
- Direct Azure experience for resume/interviews

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Demonstrates Azure experience, automatic CI/CD, cost-effective
- **Negative:** Limited to static content initially (addressed with Azure Functions later)
- **Mitigation:** Plan Azure Functions integration for dynamic features

## ADR-002: Security-First Design Approach

**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision Maker:** Project Owner  

### Context
As a cybersecurity professional transitioning to cloud security, the portfolio itself must demonstrate security best practices.

### Decision
Implement comprehensive security measures from day one:
- Content Security Policy (CSP) with restrictive directives
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- HTTPS enforcement with automatic redirects
- Input validation and XSS prevention
- Access logging and monitoring preparation

### Implementation
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "route": "/*",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; ...",
        "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload",
        "X-Frame-Options": "DENY"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Demonstrates security expertise, prevents common vulnerabilities
- **Negative:** Slightly more complex development (need to consider CSP for all resources)
- **Mitigation:** Document security decisions for learning value

## ADR-003: Documentation-Heavy Approach

**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision Maker:** Project Owner  

### Context
Need to ensure project continuity across multiple AI chat sessions and demonstrate professional communication skills.

### Decision
Create comprehensive documentation including:
- Project context for AI handoffs
- Weekly progress summaries
- Architecture decision records (this document)
- Detailed deployment guides
- Learning insights and reflections

### Structure
```
docs/
├── project-context.md (AI handoff guide)
├── week-progress/ (weekly summaries)
├── architecture-decisions.md (this file)
├── deployment-guide.md (technical setup)
└── learning-insights.md (reflections)
```

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Easy project handoffs, demonstrates technical writing, creates study notes
- **Negative:** Additional time investment in documentation
- **Mitigation:** Documentation becomes content for portfolio and learning tool

## ADR-004: Vanilla JavaScript Over Frameworks

**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision Maker:** Project Owner  

### Context
Decision needed on frontend technology stack for portfolio site.

### Options Considered
1. **React/Vue/Angular** - Modern frameworks with extensive capabilities
2. **Vanilla JavaScript** - Simple, lightweight, no build process
3. **jQuery** - Legacy but still functional
4. **Web Components** - Modern standard but limited browser support

### Decision
**Chose Vanilla JavaScript** for the following reasons:
- No build process complexity (focuses learning on Azure, not frontend tooling)
- Demonstrates fundamental JavaScript skills
- Lightweight and fast loading
- Easy to understand for anyone reviewing code
- Aligns with Azure Static Web Apps simple deployment model

### Implementation Details
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Modern ES6+ features where supported
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Modular function organization for maintainability

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Simple deployment, fast performance, clear code
- **Negative:** More verbose than framework solutions, manual DOM manipulation
- **Future Decision:** May reconsider for Azure Functions frontend if complexity grows

## ADR-005: Weekly Content Creation Schedule

**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision Maker:** Project Owner  

### Context
Need structured approach to content creation that demonstrates consistency and professional communication skills.

### Decision
Establish regular content schedule:
- **Monday:** Technical deep-dive blog post (new Azure concept learned)
- **Wednesday:** Lab documentation update (hands-on implementation)
- **Friday:** Progress summary and next week planning

### Content Strategy
1. **Blog Posts:** Technical learning with practical application
2. **Lab Docs:** Step-by-step implementations with screenshots
3. **Progress Updates:** Metrics, challenges, insights, next steps

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Consistent professional content, demonstrates commitment, creates study materials
- **Negative:** Time commitment, pressure to produce quality content weekly
- **Mitigation:** Batch content creation, maintain quality over quantity

## ADR-006: Azure CLI Over Portal for Documentation

**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision Maker:** Project Owner  

### Context
Choose between Azure Portal (GUI) and Azure CLI for resource management and documentation.

### Decision
**Prioritize Azure CLI** for the following reasons:
- Demonstrates command-line proficiency (valued in technical roles)
- Reproducible and scriptable deployments
- Better for documentation (commands can be copy-pasted)
- Aligns with Infrastructure as Code principles
- Shows automation mindset

### Implementation
- Document all Azure operations with CLI commands
- Include Portal screenshots for visual learners
- Create reusable script snippets
- Explain CLI output and error handling

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Technical depth, automation skills, reproducible processes
- **Negative:** Steeper learning curve than Portal GUI
- **Mitigation:** Use Portal for exploration, CLI for implementation and documentation

## ADR-007: Professional Tone and Presentation

**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision Maker:** Project Owner  

### Context
Portfolio serves dual purpose as learning tool and professional demonstration for job applications.

### Decision
Maintain consistently professional presentation:
- High-quality technical writing
- Professional visual design
- Industry-appropriate terminology
- Comprehensive error handling and edge cases
- Mobile-responsive design

### Standards
- Proofread all content before publishing
- Use industry-standard terminology and practices
- Include proper attribution for learning sources
- Maintain consistent branding and visual identity
- Test across multiple devices and browsers

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Professional credibility, suitable for job applications, quality learning materials
- **Negative:** Higher time investment per piece of content
- **Mitigation:** Quality over quantity, build templates for efficiency
